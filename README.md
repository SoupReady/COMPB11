# COMP B11 - Programming Concepts and Methodology I

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the discipline of computer science, with a focus on the 
design and implementation of algorithms to solve simple problems using a high-level programming 
language. Topics include fundamental programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, 
debugging techniques, declaration models, and an overview of procedural and object-oriented 
programming languages. Students will learn to design, implement, test, and debug algorithms 
using pseudocode and a high-level programming language. Not open to students who have previously 
received credit for COMS B14.

## Student Learning Outcomes
Understand and know how to use fundamental programming constructs 
•	Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs involving the fundamental programming constructs covered by this unit. 
•	Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions. • Design, implement, test, and debug a program that uses each of the following fundamental programming constructs: basic computation, simple I/O, standard conditional and iterative structures, and the definition of functions. 
•	Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task. 
• Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces. 
•	Describe the mechanics of parameter passing. 
•	Design, implement, test, and debug simple programs in an object-oriented programming language.

Design and implement algorithms to solve problems 
•	Discuss the importance of algorithms in the problem-solving process. 
•	Identify the necessary properties of good algorithms. 
•	Create algorithms for solving simple problems. 
•	Use pseudocode or a programming language to implement, test, and debug algorithms for solving simple problems. 
•	Describe strategies that are useful in debugging.


Discuss general programming-language ideas 
•	Summarize the evolution of programming languages illustrating how this history has led to the paradigms available today. 
•	Identify at least one distinguishing characteristic for each of the programming paradigms covered in this unit.

Understand and use variables and types 
•	Explain the value of declaration models, especially with respect to programming-in-the-large. 
•	Identify and describe the properties of a variable such as its associated address, value, scope, persistence, and size. 
•	Discuss type incompatibility. •	Demonstrate different forms of binding, visibility, scoping, and lifetime management. 
•	Defend the importance of types and type-checking in providing abstraction and safety. 
•	Design and implement user-defined types, using Object-Oriented principles.
