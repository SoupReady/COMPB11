## Homework 4-A

Write a program, (homework4.java) that prompts for an employee name, a 3 digit employee ID, their hourly rate, 
and the number of hours worked in a week.

Compute their weekly pay. Be sure to compute any overtime earned. Overtime should be computed as 150%
of their hourly rate. Then print out a paystub displaying their weekly wages.

Your output should be similar to the following.


```console
ID    Employee     Rate Hours    Wages
___________________________________________
000   Eddie Rangel   10    45      475
```

Note: To create the table, use field widths with left and right alignment in your printf format strings. Also, note that character data
is normally left aligned and numeric data is normally right aligned.
